# .codepressignore
# 
# This file allows you to specify additional files/patterns to ignore during code review.
# CodePress comes with sensible defaults for common files (lock files, node_modules, build artifacts, etc.)
# 
# You can add your own patterns here. Patterns follow the same syntax as .gitignore.
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.

# Examples of additional patterns you might want to ignore:

# Specific files
# README.md
# CHANGELOG.md

# Generated documentation
# docs/api/
# *.generated.ts

# Test files (if you don't want them reviewed)
# *.test.ts
# *.spec.js
# test/
# __tests__/

# Configuration files
# webpack.config.js
# rollup.config.js
# *.config.ts

# Large data files
# *.json
# *.csv
# data/

# Specific directories in your project
# scripts/
# tools/
# migrations/

# To INCLUDE a file that's ignored by defaults, use the ! prefix:
# This forces review of yarn.lock even though lock files are ignored by default
# !yarn.lock

# You can unignore multiple lock files if needed:
# !yarn.lock
# !package-lock.json
# !composer.lock

# Or force review of specific config files:
# !webpack.config.js
# !rollup.config.js
