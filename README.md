## Review Output Format

CodePress Review uses a structured XML format for consistent, rich code review comments. Each finding includes:

- **Severity**: `required`, `optional`, `nit`, or `fyi`
- **Inline Comments**: Posted directly on the relevant line
- **Suggestions**: Optional code improvements with syntax highlighting
- **Examples**: Optional code blocks demonstrating best practices

Example output format:

````xml
<comment>
  <severity>required</severity>
  <file>src/components/Button.tsx</file>
  <line>+  onClick?: () => void;</line>
  <message>Consider making onClick required for better UX - users expect buttons to be interactive.</message>
  <suggestion>+  onClick: () => void;</suggestion>
  <code>
    ```tsx
    interface ButtonProps {
      text: string;
      onClick: () => void; // required for user interaction
    }
    ```
  </code>
</comment>
````

## Two-Pass Review System

CodePress Review uses a sophisticated **two-pass review system** for enhanced code analysis:

1. **First Pass - Diff Summarization**: Analyzes the entire diff to identify PR type, key themes, and risks
2. **Second Pass - Chunk Review**: Reviews each code chunk with context from the first pass

This provides global awareness while maintaining focused, line-level feedback.

## Custom Review Guidelines

You can customize the review behavior by creating a `custom-codepress-review-prompt.md` file in the root of your repository. If this file exists, CodePress will use your custom guidelines instead of the default ones.

### Creating Custom Guidelines

Create a file named `custom-codepress-review-prompt.md` in your repository root:

```markdown
# My Custom Review Guidelines

You are a code reviewer focusing on:

- Security vulnerabilities and best practices
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Code maintainability and readability
- Proper error handling

Use these severity levels:

- **required**: Critical issues that must be fixed
- **optional**: Suggestions for improvement
- **nit**: Minor style or polish issues
- **fyi**: Informational notes
```

### Example Custom Guidelines

#### Security-Focused Review

```markdown
# Security-Focused Code Review

You are a security expert reviewing code for vulnerabilities. Focus on:

## Security Priorities

- Authentication and authorization issues
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF vulnerabilities
- Sensitive data exposure
- Cryptographic implementations
- Third-party dependency vulnerabilities

## Severity Guidelines

- **required**: Critical security vulnerabilities that expose the system to attack
- **optional**: Security improvements that enhance the overall security posture
- **nit**: Minor security polish (logging, error messages)
- **fyi**: Security-related information for future consideration

Always explain the potential impact of security issues and provide concrete remediation steps.
```

#### Performance-Focused Review

```markdown
# Performance-Focused Code Review

You are a performance optimization expert. Review this code for:

## Performance Areas

- Inefficient algorithms and data structures
- Memory leaks and excessive allocations
- Database query optimization opportunities
- Caching and batching improvements
- Network request optimization
- Unnecessary computations or iterations

## Guidelines

- Provide concrete performance improvements with estimated impact
- Suggest specific optimizations with code examples
- Identify potential bottlenecks and scaling issues
- Focus on measurable improvements

Use **required** for critical performance issues, **optional** for optimizations.
```

#### Beginner-Friendly Review

```markdown
# Beginner-Friendly Code Review

You are a patient mentor reviewing code from a junior developer. Your feedback should be:

## Mentoring Approach

- Educational and encouraging
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Include code examples when helpful
- Focus on learning opportunities
- Provide resources for further learning

## Tone Guidelines

- Use positive, constructive language
- Acknowledge good practices when you see them
- Offer alternatives rather than just pointing out problems
- Encourage best practices without being overwhelming

Prefer **optional** for learning opportunities, **nit** for style, **fyi** for educational notes.
```

### Custom Summarization Guidelines

You can also customize the initial diff summarization by creating a `custom-codepress-summary-prompt.md` file in your repository root. This allows you to tailor how CodePress analyzes and summarizes your pull requests.

#### Creating Custom Summary Guidelines

Create a file named `custom-codepress-summary-prompt.md` in your repository root:

```markdown
# Custom PR Summary Guidelines

You are analyzing a complete pull request. Focus on:

## Analysis Priorities

- API design and breaking changes
- Cross-service dependencies
- Database migration impacts
- Performance implications at scale
- Security considerations in architectural changes

## Classification Guidelines

- Classify the PR type accurately: feature | bugfix | refactor | docs | test | chore | dependency-bump | mixed
- Identify key architectural concerns that reviewers should be aware of
- Highlight any risks that span multiple files or components

## Output Focus

- Provide concise, actionable insights for individual chunk reviewers
- Flag cross-cutting concerns that might not be obvious from individual file changes
- Emphasize testing strategies for complex changes
```

## Cost & Performance Caveats

- LLM usage may incur costs depending on provider/model.
- Review time and cost scale with diff size and model selection.

## Fork Safety

If you want to run this bot on PRs from forks, use `pull_request_target` instead of `pull_request` in your workflow trigger. **Warning:** This exposes repository secrets to forked PRs. For maximum safety, use a low-privilege Personal Access Token (PAT) with only `pull-requests: write` and `contents: read` scopes, and store it as a secret (e.g., `REVIEW_BOT_TOKEN`).

Update the workflow:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
```

And set:

```yaml
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Version Comparison

### v2 (Current) - Interactive Agent Architecture

CodePress Review v2 introduces a sophisticated **interactive agent system** powered by OpenAI's agents framework:

- **ü§ñ Interactive Tools**: Agent can fetch additional file context, analyze dependencies, and explore code relationships
- **üîç Smart Context Gathering**: When reviewing diffs, the agent can request full file contents or specific code snippets for better understanding
- **üìä Dependency Analysis**: Built-in tools to analyze import/export relationships and project structure
- **üéØ Context-Aware Reviews**: No more false positives from missing context - the agent sees the full picture
- **‚ö° Adaptive Processing**: Agent determines when additional context is needed and fetches it automatically

**Key Benefits of v2:**

- Eliminates incorrect comments about "missing" code that exists outside diff chunks
- Provides more accurate reviews by understanding full file context
- Reduces false positives for unused imports, missing migrations, etc.
- Offers deeper architectural insights through dependency analysis

### v1 (Legacy) - Static Diff Review

CodePress Review v1 uses a traditional static approach:

- **üìù Diff-Only Analysis**: Reviews only the visible diff chunks without additional context
- **üöÄ Faster Processing**: Single-pass review with no additional API calls
- **üí∞ Lower Cost**: Minimal token usage per review
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Context**: May miss relationships between files or make assumptions about missing code

**When to Use v1:**

- Cost-sensitive environments where minimal token usage is priority
- Simple codebases where diff context is usually sufficient
- Legacy workflows that don't require advanced context analysis

### Migration Guide

To use v1 instead of v2, simply change the version in your workflow:

```yaml
# For v2 (recommended - interactive agent)
uses: quantfive/codepress-review@v2

# For v1 (legacy - static diff review)
uses: quantfive/codepress-review@v1
```

**Note:** v2 is the recommended version for most use cases due to its superior accuracy and context awareness.

## Technical Architecture

This project uses the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction) (`ai` package) for all LLM providers. The system:

- **Clean TypeScript Functions**: System prompts managed in `src/system-prompt.ts`
- **Proper Message Structure**: Uses system prompt for guidelines + user prompt for diff content
- **Preserved Response Format**: Always includes XML `<responseFormat>` regardless of custom prompts
- **Structured XML Output**: Parses XML responses for rich comment formatting
- **Severity System**: `required`, `optional`, `nit`, `fyi` with emoji indicators
- **Hunk-Based Processing**: Each diff hunk processed individually for focused reviews
- **Line Resolution**: Handles line number mapping from diff context
- **File-Based Customization**: Custom review guidelines from `custom-codepress-review-prompt.md` and summary guidelines from `custom-codepress-summary-prompt.md`
- **Interactive Agent Tools** (v2): `fetch_file`, `fetch_snippet`, and `dep_graph` for enhanced context gathering
